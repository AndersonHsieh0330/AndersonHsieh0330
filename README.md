- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Anderson Hsieh
- I'm a 4th-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
- Started my tech journey from QA and Software, I now focus on digital hardware and ASIC design. Check out my [resume](https://github.com/AndersonHsieh0330/Resume/blob/master/Resume_AndersonHsieh.pdf) for more details!
- I believe the best way to learn is through personal projects. My most recent one is the [WF8 8-bit Microproessor](https://github.com/AndersonHsieh0330/WF8), where I implemented hardware in Verilog to run programs written in my own [custom ISA](https://github.com/AndersonHsieh0330/softcore_cpu#instruction-set-architecture).
- I am also currently in charge of the task/order management system for Bristle Co. Ltd, a wheel brush manufacturing company located in Taoyuan Taiwan. Check out [Bristle](https://github.com/Bristle-Co) under my Github profile -> Organizations for more!
- My short-term goal is to explore analog circuit design and utilize Tiny Taypeout and Skywater130 pdk.
- Looking for Fall 2024 internship in related fields, please feel free to reach out to me if opportunities come across.
