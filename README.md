- 👋 Hi, I’m Anderson Hsieh
- I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
- Started my tech journey from QA and Software, I now focus on digital hardware and ASIC design. Check out my [resume](https://github.com/AndersonHsieh0330/Resume/blob/AndroidJobs/Resume_AndersonHsieh.pdf) for more details!
- I believe the best way to learn is through personal projects, and I like always having one that I'm working on. To become a true "full stack developer" and explore CPU architecture design, I'm currently building an [8-bit softcore CPU](https://github.com/AndersonHsieh0330/softcore_cpu#design-schematic) and implementing my own [custom ISA](https://github.com/AndersonHsieh0330/softcore_cpu#instruction-set-architecture).
- I am also currently in charge of the task/order management system for Bristle Co. Ltd, a wheel brush manufacturing company located in Taoyuan Taiwan. Check out [Bristle](https://github.com/Bristle-Co) under my Github profile -> Organizations for more!
- My short-term goal in the next school term is to dive deeper into semiconductor physics and circuit design, this means finishing the 8-bit CPU project and shifting into digital circuit design projects.
- Looking for Winter and Fall 2024 internship in related fields, please feel free to reach out to me if opportunities come across.
