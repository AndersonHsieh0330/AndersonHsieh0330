- I'm a second-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo and this is where I currently live.
- I'm into mobile apps development and mainly work on native Android with Kotlin/Java. However, I'm also interested in other front-end frameworks like React, as well as backend technologies like Spring, MySQL. 
- My short term goal is to become a full stack developer who is capable of implementing all areas of a software system and I am currently seeking Winter 2023 Coop opportunities, please contact me through the following:
